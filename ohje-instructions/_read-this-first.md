# Welcome! So you want to help, here's what you need to know



## Click and it's online!

Whenever you commit and push a file to this repository, **it goes online immediately**! Only exception is the [_drafts directory](../_drafts). You can work in that directory until your article is ready.

So **please commit only finished content that is ready** for the world to see. 



## When you're ready, always test that your changes work




## There are nice tools that make things easier

It's perfectly fine to edit files here in Github web page. Just click the pen icon on the upper right corner of the file you need to change. When you're ready, fill in the commit-dialog under the file.

However, If you plan to do a lot of changes, you may want to spend a bit of time and install the following tools to your computer. They work on both Mac and PC:

- [Typora](https://typora.io/) is a free markdown editor and reader makes it easier to edit the files.
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) lets you edit the files in your local computer.
