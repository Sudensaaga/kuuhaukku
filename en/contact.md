To obtain a puppy from our litters, you need to contact the kennel well in advance and show genuine 
interest in the conservation work of the old breed. The puppies are sold with specific terms that
 you will be introduced to when you contact us.

Puppies are sold only by reservation and there is a queue. The reservation becomes final when the
 reservation payment has been made. 

We are happy to give you further information of the breed and the dogs!
You are welcome to visit and see the dogs yourself.
